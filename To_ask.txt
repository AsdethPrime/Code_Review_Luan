For 1B
1) Attributes within part variable:
    Do the attribute need to be private?
    In the code snipped first the variables are declared as private (__)
    Later in the method they are called as if they are not private

2) The current addAssembledPart method merely creates and adds a new assembled part
    It does NOT currently update the quantity on hand for either of the orginal part 
    Is this required?
===========================================

For the funky 1B version 
1) Dataclass decorate is being used so constructor is being written behind the scene by python itself
2) Type checking included so editor will warn if you input incorrect value, even before you run it
3) Two classes, DataValidator and DataFormatter are created which
    Does not allow empty id, name to be entered 
    If empty value are provided, custom error is printed in the console and program exits
    If correct value but incorrect type is provided (for example a price of "20.20"), its automatically casted to correct value(20.20)
